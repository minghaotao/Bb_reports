Using Pandas and Matplotlob to create data visualization the support data

1. First We use MS Excel to collect all the support data since 2017. 
When the user called in, we will collect the following informaiton - 
["ID", "Agent", "CallDateTime", "CallDate", "CallTime", "CallDay", "CallCategory", "UserType", "Faculty",
           "Comment", "Department", "ContactType", "BbCategory"]

2. Then we use Python, Pandas and matplolob to filter data and create charts. 

Please see the sreenshot of the Bb tracker and images folder for some data visaul examples.
